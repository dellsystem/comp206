<p>Greetings, space voyager. It is some not-so-distant year in the future (although you probably just think of it as the present, being the futuristic person that you are) and space travel has become a commonly accepted part of life. Some people embark on interstellar journeys to look for such esoteric things like the meaning of life or the secret of the cosmos. Also aliens. Others are clearly more practical and start their journey by renting a spaceship from us and using that spaceship to establish themselves as traders of interstellar goods.</p>
<p>We trust you are a practical sort of voyager, so we'd like to offer you a deal that you will probably not refuse (although if you turn out to not be the practical sort, we will only be a bit disappointed). We will provide you a spaceship, a map, and some heavily marked-up fuel (we have a bit of a monopoly). In return, you get to make some money in the booming interstellar trade market and only need to pay us for the fuel that you use. We'll even give you some free Space Dollars &reg; to help you get started.</p>
<p>Well, what are you waiting for? To start your journey, simply press login, enter some username/password combination, and you'll be on your way to our first trade base on the moon. From there, you can venture on to the next base, or, for the mavericks out there, fly on to any base you wish. Each base will be full of eager merchants on the lookout for entreprenurial, spaceship-possessing individuals who will buy their goods and attempt to sell them, hopefully at a profit, on another base.</p>
