<p>This will be a short paragraph describing the theme of the site, the game, etc. Basically the user is some sort of space traveler trying to make some extra money through space trade. The user starts on Earth and eventually finds his way into the far reaches of outer space blah blah.</p>
<p>(This is just a demo site, using PHP for easier testing/etc, to showcase the template. Check out the login page, the rooms, and the credits page. If everyone is okay with the design I will put up the final version of the template on github and put up instructions on creating your room using the template (so you can modify the background and the content). Should happen by Thursday night.)</p>
