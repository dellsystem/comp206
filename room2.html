<p>The background image is a sand dune because 1) I've never read dune; 2) sand dunes are awesome; and 3) Harry is a nerd. Replace this background image with a more appropriate one as you wish (although I really can't think of anything more appropriate than a sand dune).</p>

<p>At the moment, it's possible to go to a planet/thing without first logging in. That is not good, but it doesn't matter, because this PHP-based site is just to show what the site might look like. Ignore any PHP-related bugs, please.</p>
