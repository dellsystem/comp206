I think I explained pretty much everything in the comments.
The key  used is 1. I'll change that once we get login.cgi working.
If you #define DEBUG, you can see login.cgi in action.
The room1path and login_error path are #defined at the beginning of login.c, so change that whenever you want.

Also, enter "make all" in the "login folder" to compile login.c, print.c and cipher.c into login.cgi. login.cgi is then automatically copied to the home folder (ass5).
