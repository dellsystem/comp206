<p>You have reached Federation Space Station <i>William A. Shatner</i>, commonly known as simply the SSS. Named after the legendary 21st-century icon, the SSS serves as the main trading hub for the Alpha Centauri quadrant.</i> 
<p>With over 30 million full-time residents living on the station (not so affectionately known as 'Shats'), and hundreds of millions more passing through each day, the SSS has been ranked as the most profitable orbital settlement for the Federation. Galactic economists have pointed to its extremely low space tariffs and its place as the headquarters of three of the five FTL engine megacorps as the main reasons for its success.</p>
<p>However, below the lucrative financial district is the SSS' black market. Illegal cloners and spice runners have lead to a rampant increase in bribery in recent years, due mostly to the discovery of a new drug from Memento Mori. Even more infamous is the SSS' red-light district, with its unofficial motto, "Providing pleasure regardless of number of appendages!"</p>
<p>Recently elected Federation Executive Janeway Sisko has declared a crackdown on illegal trading, though most smugglers have continued to disregard her warnings. The choice of whether to make humble, but legal trades or risk it all on the black market is up to you.
