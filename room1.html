<p>So the first place you land upon leaving Earth is the moon. Which makes sense, really, seeing as it's closer to Earth than any of the other things.</p>
<p>What can you do here, besides marvel at your sudden weight loss? Well, the main attractions on this desolate moonscape are the trading of illicit moon dust and the harvesting of green cheese. Luckily for you, you don't even have to get your hands dirty if you want to acquire some delicious green cheese - you can buy some from the local traders for almost nothing. Unfortunately, that is also how much green cheese is valued outside of the moon, so don't expect to get rich buying and selling this commodity. Still, there's always an eccentric green-cheese fancier somewhere in the universe, so you might as well give this commodity a shot.</p>
<p>Once you get bored of the moon, go ahead and venture to another region. Every voyage you make will cost you quite a bit of fuel, so make sure every trip you make will be profitable. Click the <code>GO LEFT</code> and <code>GO RIGHT</code> buttons to follow the recommended path, or, if you fancy yourself to be a maverick, you can venture off on your own by selecting any region (even this one!). Go on, and good luck on your journey.
