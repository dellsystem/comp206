<p>So the first place you land upon leaving Earth is the moon. Which makes sense, really, seeing as it's closer to Earth than any of the other things.</p>
<p>What can you do here, besides marvel at your sudden weight loss? Well, the main attractions on this desolate moonscape are the trading of illicit moon dust and the collecting of green cheese. Luckily for you, you don't even have to get your hands dirty if you want to acquire some delicious green cheese - you can buy some from the local traders for almost nothing. Unfortunately, that is also how much green cheese is valued outside of the moon, so don't expect to get rich buying and selling this commodity.</p>
<p>Once you get bored of the moon, go ahead and venture to another region. Note that every time you travel, you face the risk of getting hijacked by interstellar pirates, so beware. Maybe you can buy things that lessen your risk of being attacked. Click the "go right" and "go left" icons to follow the recommended path, or venture off on your own by selecting any region (even this one! Go on, try it).</p>
