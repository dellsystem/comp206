<p>You have reached the dying planet Memento Mori. The matter on its soil is in constant decay and soon you will hear no more of it. Luckily, "soon" in inter-galactic jargon equates to "a couple of thousand years on Earth".
</p>
<p>
In Memento Mori, the law "kill or be killed" is applied to its fullest. Some plants secrete powerful and highly-efficient poisons while numerous species have developed a full-fledged resistance to epidemic diseases, grown steel-strong shells or mutated into gigantic monsters.
</p>
<p>
As a local trader of Memento Mori, I have challenged Death itself to bring you the finest of products: 
<ul>
<li>The serum of Life: Concocted with the blood of silver Rodworves, it is said that one drop of this serum can heal a person on her dying bed.</li>
<li>Manthrax: This poison simulates a heart-attack. Cherished by hitmen across the universe, Manthrax serves their sinister deeds with discretion.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Sure, Memento Mori is at the tip of the universe, it is hard to reach and the risk of interstellar robbery is at its peak. However, you can buy this planet's invaluable fruits for a reasonable price and, in exchange, receive a man's infinite gratitude or serve the interests of a corrupt, WEALTHY politician. 
</p>
<p>
Either way, this is an offer you cannot refuse.
