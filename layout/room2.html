<p>Long known as the universe's only source of the spice melange, Arrakis (aka Dune) is known to be unforgiving, cruel, and most of all: dry. Ironically enough the most valuable substance to the nomadic inhabitants is not the addictive red powder but water, which they conserve with an extraordinary zeal.</p>

<p>Dune is a desperately sought after planet for the melange resource, which is sold at seemingly outrageous prices to decidedly willing customers throught the galaxy. This may seem lucrative, but know that every other aspiring trader in the universe is well aware of these facts, and will often not stop at anything to secure their haul. Tread lightly upon the vast expanses of desert in Dune, for there is more beneath the sand than you may expect.</p>
