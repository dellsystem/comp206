<p>Welcome to the Orion Nebula! </p> 
<p> Here you will able to buy purple cloud candy -like candy floss but cooler- and faerie dust -what dreams are made of.</p>
<p>All these items are available from local purple shops -the Orion equivalent of a mall.</p>
<p>This nebula may seem like a very secure place, but beware of the pixies, who trade on the large black market. They might offer rare goods but their prices can vary a lot, and many rich traders have come back from Orion emptyhanded after being lured into deals by the pixies. </p>
