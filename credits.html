<p>At first glance, this innocuous, desert-filled planet seems to hold no interest for the average trader. However, beneath the never-ending expanses of sand lie vast reserves of melange, an exotic drug that many will stop at nothing to get their hands on. If you can manage to stake your place in this dangerous market, the payoffs are immense.<!-- temp dune description in case harry doesn't update his shit in time ... harry when you edit remove this (obviously), i'll pull when i see a change--></p>

<strong>Wanwan Liu</strong> - <a href="index.php?mode=room1">The moon</a><br />
<p>Despite its harsh barrenness and rather dull (i.e. oxygen-free) atmosphere, the moon has proven to be a popular spot for miners and traders trying to strike it rich in the green cheese business. Many intrepid young adventurers are pulled in by the lure of this growing, if slightly off-kilter, market, only to soon find themselves in a state of anoxia. Don't forget your helmet.<br /><a href="http://dellsystem.github.com">http://dellsystem.github.com</a> </p>

<p>The Orion Nebula: this room is doubtlessly the most purple place in the universe. It gives you the opportunity to trade a world of purpleness. Centrally located in the universe, it is the trader's stop on the way to more dangerous galaxies.</p>
